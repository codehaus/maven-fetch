      	What is Fetch?
	  </p>
	  <p>
        Fetch is a simple, lightweight package for downloading single resources.
        It does not try to be a commons-httpclient, a commons-vfs or any of the other
        larger, more complete utilities for interacting with remote servers.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		It's purpose is to fill the niche for Maven bootstraps such that only
        a minimum of dependencies are required - and that those dependencies
        are lightweight and reliable.
